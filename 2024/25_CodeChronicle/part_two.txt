----- Day 25: Code Chronicle -----

----- Part Two -----

You and The Historians crowd into the office, startling the Chief Historian
awake! The Historians all take turns looking confused until one asks where
he's been for the last few months.

"I've been right here, working on this high-priority request from Santa! I
think the only time I even stepped away was about a month ago when I went
to grab a cup of coffee..."

Just then, the Chief notices the time. "Oh no! I'm going to be late! I must
have fallen asleep trying to put the finishing touches on this chronicle
Santa requested, but now I don't have enough time to go visit the last 50
places on my list and complete the chronicle before Santa leaves! He said
he needed it before tonight's sleigh launch."

One of The Historians holds up the list they've been using this whole time
to keep track of where they've been searching. Next to each place you all
visited, they checked off that place with a star. Other Historians hold up
their own notes they took on the journey; as The Historians, how could they
resist writing everything down while visiting all those historically
significant places?

The Chief's eyes get wide. "With all this, we might just have enough time
to finish the chronicle! Santa said he wanted it wrapped up with a bow, so
I'll call down to the wrapping department and... hey, could you bring it up
to Santa? I'll need to be in my seat to watch the sleigh launch by then."

You nod, and The Historians quickly work to collect their notes into the
final set of pages for the chronicle.
