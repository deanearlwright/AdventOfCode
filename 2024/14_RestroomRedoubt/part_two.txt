----- Day 14: Restroom Redoubt -----

----- Part Two -----

During the bathroom break, someone notices that these robots seem awfully
similar to ones built and used at the North Pole. If they're the same type
of robots, they should have a hard-coded Easter egg: very rarely, most of
the robots should arrange themselves into a picture of a Christmas tree.

What is the fewest number of seconds that must elapse for the robots to
display the Easter egg?
