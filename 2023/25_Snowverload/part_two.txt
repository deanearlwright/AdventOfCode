Advent of Code 2023 Day 25 Part Two

From https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/25 by Eric Wastl

----- Day 25: Snowverload -----

----- Part Two -----

You climb over weather machines, under giant springs, and narrowly avoid a
pile of pipes as you find and disconnect the three wires.

A moment after you disconnect the last wire, the big red reset button
module makes a small ding noise:

System overload resolved!
Power required is now 50 stars.

Out of the corner of your eye, you notice goggles and a loose-fitting hard
hat peeking at you from behind an ultra crucible. You think you see a faint
glow, but before you can investigate, you hear another small ding:

Power required is now 49 stars.

Please supply the necessary stars and
push the button to restart the system.

You don't have enough stars to restart the system, though. You need 1 more.

---

You have enough stars to Push the Big Red Button.

---

You supply all fifty stars and restart global snow production!

As you reach the edge of Snow Island, you can already tell from way up here
that everyone will have a white Christmas this year after all.
