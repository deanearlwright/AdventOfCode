----- Day 23: A Long Walk -----

----- Part Two -----

As you reach the trailhead, you realize that the ground isn't as slippery
as you expected; you'll have no problem climbing up the steep slopes.

Now, treat all slopes as if they were normal paths (.). You still want to
make sure you have the most scenic hike possible, so continue to ensure
that you never step onto the same tile twice. What is the longest hike you
can take?

In the example above, this increases the longest hike to 154 steps:
