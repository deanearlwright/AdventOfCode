----- Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon -----

----- Part Two -----

The Elves were right to be concerned; the planned lagoon would be much too
small.

After a few minutes, someone realizes what happened; someone swapped the
color and instruction parameters when producing the dig plan. They don't
have time to fix the bug; one of them asks if you can extract the correct
instructions from the hexadecimal codes.

Each hexadecimal code is six hexadecimal digits long. The first five
hexadecimal digits encode the distance in meters as a five-digit
hexadecimal number. The last hexadecimal digit encodes the direction to
dig: 0 means R, 1 means D, 2 means L, and 3 means U.

So, in the above example, the hexadecimal codes can be converted into the
true instructions:

#70c710 = R 461937
#0dc571 = D 56407
#5713f0 = R 356671
#d2c081 = D 863240
#59c680 = R 367720
#411b91 = D 266681
#8ceee2 = L 577262
#caa173 = U 829975
#1b58a2 = L 112010
#caa171 = D 829975
#7807d2 = L 491645
#a77fa3 = U 686074
#015232 = L 5411
#7a21e3 = U 500254

Digging out this loop and its interior produces a lagoon that can hold an
impressive 952408144115 cubic meters of lava.

Convert the hexadecimal color codes into the correct instructions; if the
Elves follow this new dig plan, how many cubic meters of lava could the
lagoon hold?

Your puzzle answer was 48020869073824.
