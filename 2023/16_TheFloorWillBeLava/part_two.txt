----- Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava -----

----- Part Two -----

As you try to work out what might be wrong, the reindeer tugs on your shirt
and leads you to a nearby control panel. There, a collection of buttons
lets you align the contraption so that the beam enters from any edge tile
and heading away from that edge. (You can choose either of two directions
for the beam if it starts on a corner; for instance, if the beam starts in
the bottom-right corner, it can start heading either left or upward.)

So, the beam could start on any tile in the top row (heading downward), any
tile in the bottom row (heading upward), any tile in the leftmost column
(heading right), or any tile in the rightmost column (heading left). To
produce lava, you need to find the configuration that energizes as many
tiles as possible.

In the above example, this can be achieved by starting the beam in the
fourth tile from the left in the top row:

.|<2<\....
|v-v\^....
.v.v.|->>>
.v.v.v^.|.
.v.v.v^...
.v.v.v^..\
.v.v/2\\..
<-2-/vv|..
.|<<<2-|.\
.v//.|.v..

Using this configuration, 51 tiles are energized:

.#####....
.#.#.#....
.#.#.#####
.#.#.##...
.#.#.##...
.#.#.##...
.#.#####..
########..
.#######..
.#...#.#..

Find the initial beam configuration that energizes the largest number of
tiles; how many tiles are energized in that configuration?
