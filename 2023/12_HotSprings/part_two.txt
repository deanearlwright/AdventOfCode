----- Day 12: Hot Springs -----

----- Part Two -----

As you look out at the field of springs, you feel like there are way more
springs than the condition records list. When you examine the records, you
discover that they were actually folded up this whole time!

To unfold the records, on each row, replace the list of spring conditions
with five copies of itself (separated by ?) and replace the list of
contiguous groups of damaged springs with five copies of itself (separated
by ,).

So, this row:

.# 1

Would become:

.#?.#?.#?.#?.# 1,1,1,1,1

The first line of the above example would become:

???.###????.###????.###????.###????.### 1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3

In the above example, after unfolding, the number of possible arrangements
for some rows is now much larger:

  - ???.### 1,1,3 - 1 arrangement
  - .??..??...?##. 1,1,3 - 16384 arrangements
  - ?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6 - 1 arrangement
  - ????.#...#... 4,1,1 - 16 arrangements
  - ????.######..#####. 1,6,5 - 2500 arrangements
  - ?###???????? 3,2,1 - 506250 arrangements

After unfolding, adding all of the possible arrangement counts together
produces 525152.

Unfold your condition records; what is the new sum of possible arrangement
counts?
