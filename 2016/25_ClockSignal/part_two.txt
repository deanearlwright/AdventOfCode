Advent of Code 2016 Day 25 Part Two

----- Day 25: Clock Signal -----

----- Part Two -----

The antenna is ready. Now, all you need is the fifty stars required to 
generate the signal for the sleigh, but you don't have enough.

You look toward the sky in desperation... suddenly noticing that a lone 
star has been installed at the top of the antenna! Only 49 more to go.

You don't have enough stars to transmit the signal, though. You need 7 more.
