--- Day 22: Slam Shuffle ---

--- Part Two ---
After a while, you realize your shuffling skill won't improve much more 
with merely a single deck of cards. You ask every 3D printer on the ship to 
make you some more cards while you check on the ship repairs. While 
reviewing the work the droids have finished so far, you think you see 
Halley's Comet fly past!

When you get back, you discover that the 3D printers have combined their 
power to create for you a single, giant, brand new, factory order deck of 
119315717514047 space cards.

Finally, a deck of cards worthy of shuffling!

You decide to apply your complete shuffle process (your puzzle input) to 
the deck 101741582076661 times in a row.

You'll need to be careful, though - one wrong move with this many cards and 
you might overflow your entire ship!

After shuffling your new, giant, factory order deck that many times, what 
number is on the card that ends up in position 2020?
