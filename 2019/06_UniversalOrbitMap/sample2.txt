# Visually, the above map of orbits looks like this:

#                           YOU
#                          /
#         G - H       J - K - L
#        /           /
# COM - B - C - D - E - F
#                \
#                 I - SAN

# In this example, YOU are in orbit around K, and SAN is in orbit around I. To
# move from K to I, a minimum of 4 orbital transfers are required:

#    K to J
#    J to E
#    E to D
#    D to I

# Afterward, the map of orbits looks like this:

#         G - H       J - K - L
#        /           /
# COM - B - C - D - E - F
#                \
#                 I - SAN
#                  \
#                   YOU
