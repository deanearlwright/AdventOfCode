----- Not Quite Lisp -----

----- Part Two -----

Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character 
that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1). The first character in 
the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and 
so on.

For example:

  - ) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.
  - ()()) causes him to enter the basement at character position 5.

What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?
