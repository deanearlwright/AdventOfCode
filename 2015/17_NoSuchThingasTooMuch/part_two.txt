----- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much -----

----- Part Two -----

While playing with all the containers in the kitchen, another load of 
eggnog arrives! The shipping and receiving department is requesting as 
many containers as you can spare.

Find the minimum number of containers that can exactly fit all 150 liters 
of eggnog. How many different ways can you fill that number of containers 
and still hold exactly 150 litres?

In the example above, the minimum number of containers was two. There were 
three ways to use that many containers, and so the answer there would be 3.
