----- Day 01: InverseCaptcha -----

----- Part Two -----

You notice a progress bar that jumps to 50% completion. Apparently, the
door isn't yet satisfied, but it did emit a star as encouragement. The
instructions change:

Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the
digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10
items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward
matches it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.

For example:

  - 1212 produces 6: the list contains 4 items, and all four digits match
    the digit 2 items ahead.
  - 1221 produces 0, because every comparison is between a 1 and a 2.
  - 123425 produces 4, because both 2s match each other, but no other
    digit has a match.
  - 123123 produces 12.
  - 12131415 produces 4.

What is the solution to your new captcha?
