----- Day 21: Monkey Math -----

----- Part Two -----

Due to some kind of monkey-elephant-human mistranslation, you seem to have
misunderstood a few key details about the riddle.

First, you got the wrong job for the monkey named root; specifically, you
got the wrong math operation. The correct operation for monkey root should
be =, which means that it still listens for two numbers (from the same two
monkeys as before), but now checks that the two numbers match.

Second, you got the wrong monkey for the job starting with humn:. It isn't
a monkey - it's you. Actually, you got the job wrong, too: you need to
figure out what number you need to yell so that root's equality check
passes. (The number that appears after humn: in your input is now
irrelevant.)

In the above example, the number you need to yell to pass root's equality
test is 301. (This causes root to get the same number, 150, from both of
its monkeys.)

What number do you yell to pass root's equality test?
