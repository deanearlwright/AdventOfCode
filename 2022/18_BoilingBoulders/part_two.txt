----- Day 18: Boiling Boulders -----

----- Part Two -----

Something seems off about your calculation. The cooling rate depends on
exterior surface area, but your calculation also included the surface area
of air pockets trapped in the lava droplet.

Instead, consider only cube sides that could be reached by the water and
steam as the lava droplet tumbles into the pond. The steam will expand
to reach as much as possible, completely displacing any air on the outside of
the lava droplet but never expanding diagonally.

In the larger example above, exactly one cube of air is trapped within the
lava droplet (at 2,2,5), so the exterior surface area of the lava droplet
is 58.

What is the exterior surface area of your scanned lava droplet?
