----- Day 06: Tuning Trouble -----

----- Part Two -----

Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but
still isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for messages.

A start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except
it consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.

Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the
above examples:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb: first marker after character 19
bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 23
nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 23
nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 29
zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 26

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message
marker is detected?
